    "### Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers are a family of models that have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) in recent years. Introduced in the 2017 paper **Attention is All You Need** by Vaswani et al., transformer models use the **self-attention** mechanism to learn dependencies in sequences, as opposed to the previously popular Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. This mechanism allows the model to learn the relationships between each word and others in the sequence, effectively capturing long-range dependencies in language.\n",

    "#### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BERT** is a bidirectional transformer-based model developed by Google for language modeling.\n",
    "- Instead of reading a text only from left to right or right to left, BERT processes the context in both directions to better understand the meaning of each word. This makes BERT particularly powerful in capturing context.\n",
    "- BERT is trained primarily on two tasks: **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** and **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**.\n",
    "- It is commonly used to learn pre-trained representations of language and fine-tune for specific NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPT** is a language model developed by OpenAI that processes text in a **unidirectional** (left-to-right) manner.\n",
    "- The main goal of GPT is to generate meaningful and coherent text based on a given prompt.\n",
    "- This model is highly effective in tasks like text generation, dialogue systems, summarization, and content creation.\n",
    "- GPT is an **autoregressive** model, meaning that it predicts each new word based on the previous words, generating text sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLaMA** refers to a series of large language models developed by Meta. While LLaMA models are based on the **Transformer architecture**, they have a larger training dataset and parameter capacity.\n",
    "- LLaMA models are designed for **efficiency** and **flexibility**.\n",
    "- Meta's goal with LLaMA was to develop large language models using more data but with lower resource consumption and greater efficiency.\n",
    "- A key feature of LLaMA is that it is trained on **massive datasets** and has a large number of parameters, resulting in strong language modeling capabilities.\n",
