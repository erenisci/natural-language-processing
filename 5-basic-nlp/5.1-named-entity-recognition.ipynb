    "### Named Entity Recognitiyon (NER) (w/ Spacy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and classifying named entities (such as persons, locations, organizations, dates, etc.) within text. It is a key component of natural language processing (NLP), as it helps machines understand the context and structure of the text by recognizing specific, meaningful entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common examples of Named Entity Recognition include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Person: Identifying names of individuals (e.g., \"Barack Obama\").\n",
    "  - Location: Identifying geographic locations (e.g., \"Paris\").\n",
    "  - Organization: Identifying names of organizations (e.g., \"Microsoft\").\n",
    "  - Date: Identifying specific dates (e.g., \"January 1, 2025\").\n",
    "  - Miscellaneous: Identifying other entities like events or products.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, NER focuses on recognizing and extracting named entities from text, making it easier to perform further analysis, like categorization, information retrieval, or relationship extraction.\n",
