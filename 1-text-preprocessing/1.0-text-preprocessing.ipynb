    "The first and very important stage of the NLP process is Preprocessing. Raw text data goes through several steps before being converted into a format that computers can understand and process. These steps are performed to clean, correct, and shape the data. By doing so, it helps improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model.\n",

   "source": [
    "- Removing Special Characters and Numbers: \n",
    "  * Unnecessary special characters (such as \"@\", \"#\", \"%\") and numbers that do not aid the model’s understanding are removed. This step cleans up elements that do not change the meaning of the text."

   "source": [
    "- Removing Stop Words: \n",
    "  * Stop words are words that do not carry significant meaning and do not notably change the text’s meaning (such as \"and\", \"a\", \"the\", \"for\"). These words are removed in most NLP applications."

    "- Punctuation Removal: \n",
    "  * Punctuation marks (., ?, !, :) are sometimes removed as they do not add meaning during analysis. However, in some cases (such as question marks indicating questions or punctuation indicating sentence endings), these marks may retain significance, and thus, they are removed only when necessary."

    "    \n",
